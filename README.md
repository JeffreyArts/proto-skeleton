# Proto Skeleton

This prototyping skeleton is meant for experimenting some philosophies I have about the requirements of rapid prototyping and how you should structure it.

I try to tackle the following issues within this skeleton:
- Share datamodels between back- & front-end
- Make sockets easier to work with
- Seperate different types of processes, but share the code as much as possible
- A way to keep your code as consistent as possible
- How to create code which is simple, so it needs less documentation
- Have configurable services
- Increase code quality by adding tests, in such a format it is easy to see which code is tested, and which is not.

It will also empower you directly to run the following services
- Initialization process
- REST API
- Socket server
- Mail server [in progress]

There should be support for multiple applications, hooked to this back-end architecture. These kind of apps should not be limited to any platform. Webapps, mobile apps, tv apps, desktop applications, everything should be possible.
